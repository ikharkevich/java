# Java Exercises

This repository contains solutions for several exercises.

Exercise 1
A program that asks the user for a number and then prints a statement depending on the number given. 
Different numbers correspond to different outputs.

Exercise 2
A program that prompts the user for the radii of three circles. 
It checks whether the radii are equal and prints a respective statement.

Exercise 3
A program that asks the user for a text string. 
It modifies the string by replacing and truncating words, based on certain conditions.

Exercise 4
A program that accepts a text string from the user. 
It scans the string for vowels and prints them out.

Exercise 5
A 2D matrix program that prompts the user for the size of a matrix. 
The maximum and minimum main and secondary diagonal elements are then found and printed. 
Note: The matrix size input by the user should match the actual matrix dimensions.

Exercise 6
A program that calculates the area and the perimeter of a regular polygon, based on the number of sides and the radius of the circumcircle provided by the user.

Exercise 7
A program that lets the user enter a sentence and then replays them the number of words and the number of characters used.

Exercise 8
A program that generates an array n items long, filled with random numbers, which then returns the array without zero values.

To run each program, navigate to the appropriate directory and then compile and run the Java file.


## Note
These exercises are basic problems for practicing Java. They are excellent for beginners for better understanding loops, conditionals, input/output, string operations, and working with matrices in Java. 

For each exercise, please review the code for details.
